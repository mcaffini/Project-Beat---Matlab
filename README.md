### A set of tools and a GUI for Bruker data in Matlab

Project BEAT (Bruker Edit and Analyze Tools) is a cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) set of tools for the visualization and
analysis of Bruker data (images, volumes and spectra), originally written in Matlab.
BEAT also provides tools for data conversion (Bruker, Analyze 7.5, NIfTI, DICOM and other standardized formats).

BEAT contains a GUI for images and spectra visualization, a tool for spectrum analysis (FID and spectrum visualization,
apodization, phase correction, peak selection and area under the curve computation) and a tool to display a list of acquired
sequences, provided with a sort & filtering tool (by protocol, sequence, date and time).
Full support for the Mayo Clinic Analyze 7.5 format was also added.
